\title{'cito': Building and training neural networks}
\description{
Building and training custom neural networks in the typical R syntax. The 'torch' package is used for numerical calculations, which allows for training on CPU as well as on a graphics card.
The main function is \code{\link{dnn}} which trains a custom deep neural network.
