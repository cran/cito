\usage{
analyze_training(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a model created by \code{\link{dnn}}}
}
\value{
a 'plotly' figure
}
\description{
After training a model with cito, this function helps to analyze the training process and decide on best performing model.
Creates a 'plotly' figure which allows to zoom in and out on training graph
}
\details{
The baseline loss is the most important reference. If the model was not able to achieve a better (lower) loss than the baseline (which is the loss for a intercept only model), the model probably did not converge. Possible reasons include an improper learning rate, too few epochs, or too much regularization. See the \code{?dnn} help or the \code{vignette("B-Training_neural_networks")}.
